\description{
A Tecator Infratec Food and Feed Analyzer working in the wavelength range
850 - 1050 nm by the Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) principle was used to
collect data on samples of finely chopped pure meat. 215 samples were
measured. For each sample, the fat content was measured along with a 100
channel spectrum of absorbances. Since determining the fat content via
analytical chemistry is time consuming we would like to build a model to
predict the fat content of new samples using the 100 absorbances which can
be measured more easily.
